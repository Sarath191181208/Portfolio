          <p class="desc">
            Wireworld is a cellular automaton first proposed by Brian Silverman
            in 1987, as part of his program Phantom Fish Tank. It subsequently
            became more widely known as a result of an article in the "Computer
            Recreations" column of Scientific American. Wireworld is
            particularly suited to simulating transistors, and Wireworld is
            Turing-complete i.e It can simulate a turning machine.

            Didn't you play Rock Paper Scissors when you were a kid! This takes
            me back. It is the classical game of Rock, Paper, Scissors but with
            a twist it's played with Computer using hand tracking. It is made
            using Mediapipe.

            Fourier transform a function that converts the function of time to
            function of frequency. This project uses Fourier transform to darw
            the svg's using the epicycles. \({X_k = \sum x_n \cdot e^{-i 2 \pi k

            Google maps the most used maps right now! uses path finding
            algorithms to find the shortest path between two locations such one
            algorithm is A*. This simple application in python using pygame
            inspired from tech with tim (a youtuber) visualses A* algorithm.

            A tic tac toe game against a computer which searches for moves using
            backtracking. Practically speaking you can never beat this AI! What
            ? Yeah that's true all the tic-tac-toe games have been played and
            all of them end in draw! if neither side makes a mistake. Regardless
            it's a fun game to play.
